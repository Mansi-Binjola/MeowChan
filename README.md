## Inspiration
I was always afraid of cats. But I liked watching them. They are so cute that it can make any sad person so happy. So I thought hey lets make my own discord bot which makes me happy.
## What it does
It is a discord bot made using python, discord py and the TheCatapi. It is simple command based bot which has following commands:-
1. meow-image (shows random image of cat)
2. meow-gif ( shows random gif of cat)
3. meow-save( saves the previous shown image/gif of cat )
4. meow-command( shows list of all command available for meowchan)

## How we built it
Built with python and TheCatApi.
## Challenges we ran into
Learning something new and implementing it has been always challenging to me. So for me, Creating a discord bot from scratch and using API and implementing it. 
## Accomplishments that we're proud of
